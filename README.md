# Remote-Control-Of-Mobile-Screen-projection-and-Control-on-PC-Laptop
For Cluster Automation testing of features like Screen Mirroring, Navigation, Music and Call functionality, the mobile screen should be projected on the PC/Laptop. 
The PC should be able to control mobile . 
The connection between PC and Mobile can be through USB or WiFi. 
Mobile operation control. 
Mobile screen projection on PC. 
Backend software using python to capture and process images.
Defining & executing basic test cases to test above mentioned features automatically.
To make the automation process more seamless I have also coded two shortcut buttons with help of python ,where one could project mobile screen projection on Laptop/PC and another could capture and process that  projection , hence these processes can be done just by clicking on one of the buttons as per your choice.
